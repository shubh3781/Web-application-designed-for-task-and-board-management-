Project Overview
The project appears to be a web application designed for task and board management with user authentication and task assignment capabilities. It leverages Flask as the backend framework, Google Firebase for authentication and Firestore database, and integrates with Google Cloud Datastore for data storage.

Key Components
1. Flask Backend
Flask 2.0.3: Used for serving the web application, handling requests, and rendering templates.
Google Cloud Datastore 2.4.0 & Google Auth 1.30.0: For data storage and management, and handling user authentication through Google.
Requests 2.27.1: Utilized for making HTTP requests to external services.
Flask-Session: For session management across the application.
2. Firebase Integration
Firebase Authentication: Handles user sign-in and sign-out functionality, allowing users to log in via Google or email.
Firebase Configurations: Established in app-setup.js, configuring the application to use Firebase services.
3. Frontend
HTML Templates: Two main templates, index.html and display_board.html, serve as the entry points for user interaction.
JavaScript: scripts.js and app-setup.js are used for Firebase authentication and application setup.
CSS: A single stylesheet style.css (not directly analyzed) for styling the application's UI.
4. Main Features
User Authentication: Users can sign in using Google or email. Post-authentication, users can sign out or proceed with task and board management.
Board Management: Users can create, rename, or remove boards. Validation ensures that boards with existing tasks or users cannot be removed directly.
Task Management: Within boards, users can add tasks with titles and due dates, edit or delete tasks, and assign tasks to users. Tasks can also be marked as completed.
Functionality
User Authentication Flow: The application utilizes Firebase Authentication for handling user sign-in and sign-out. Users are redirected to the home page upon successful authentication, and their session tokens are managed via cookies.
Board Operations: Users can perform CRUD operations on boards they create. Only the board owner has the rights to rename or remove a board.
Task Operations: Users can add, edit, assign, or delete tasks within a board. A task can only be marked as completed by the assigned user.
User and Task Assignment: The application supports adding users to boards and assigning tasks to users within a board. The UI dynamically updates to reflect these changes.
Dependencies
The requirements.txt file lists the Python package dependencies necessary for running the application, ensuring consistent environments across development and production setups.

Security and Authentication
Firebase Authentication: Provides a secure authentication system, with support for various sign-in methods.
Service Account: A JSON file (cpa1-345710-33a125154942.json) contains sensitive credentials for accessing Google Cloud services programmatically.
